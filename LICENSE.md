By downloading, installing, distributing or using the CAKE application, you agree with these restrictions, including (without

## R VERSION

The CAKE application has been designed to interface with R (http://www.r-project.org/) which is included
in the installer and installed alongside the CAKE program files (independently of any installation of R you
may have on your system). By downloading, installing, distributing or using the CAKE application, you
acknowledge and accept that the CAKE application has not been tested with any version of R other than
the one bundled with the installer.

By Installing CAKE you are implicitly agreeing to the R licensing terms
<http://cran.r-project.org/web/licenses/GPL-2>

Source code of R available upon request or at the R site at
<http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.0.0.tar.gz>

## ALGORITHMS

The CAKE application interfaces to and calls on algorithms implemented in R (“R Modules”). The source
code files of these R Modules are derivative works of the R package 'mkin' (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mkin/). These R Modules (but not the CAKE application itself, which is licensed on the terms above) are provided to you under a separate licence agreement (GNU General Public License (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), version 3). See the source files for the R Modules for more details.

## THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS

This installation includes the LumenWorks CSV library which is licensed under the MIT licence (<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>).

This installation includes the EPPlus library which is licensed under the L-GPL licence
(<http://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0>).

The R Modules require some R packages in order to function. These packages are separate from the
CAKE application and the R Modules. The licence for each explicitly licensed R package can be found in
the LICENSE file within the package folder. Before using these packages, you should review these
license files.

In order to operate the CAKE application, you will need the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 Runtime;
this will be downloaded and installed automatically for you by the CAKE installer if you do not already have it.
By installing CAKE, you agree to the installation of this third-party component if necessary.
